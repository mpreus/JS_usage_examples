# JS_usage_examples
Examples of JavaScript usage for various demands. 
All in Polish for convenience those who have just started learning JavaScript.
I intend to enhance my JS skills by presenting and explainig examples of JavaScript code snippets.
In those examples where it was possible I exploited ES6 notation.
I double-checked each example by running the code to be sure they work properly. 
Some of them are presented as a working examples with HTML & JS files in separate folders.

I have used various internet resources incl. firts of all:
